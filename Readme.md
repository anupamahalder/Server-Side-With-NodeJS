## Cors
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header-based mechanism that enables a server or API to specify origins from which resources can be accessed and loaded. CORS is used for authorized resource sharing with external third parties. For example, CORS is needed when pulling data from external APIs or allowing authorized third-party access to a server's resources
